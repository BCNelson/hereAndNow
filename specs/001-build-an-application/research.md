# Research Report: Context-Aware Task Management System

**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Feature**: Here and Now Task Management  
**Branch**: 001-build-an-application

## Executive Summary
Research findings for implementing a context-aware task management system using Go and SQLite, designed for self-hosting with multiple frontend support.

## Technology Decisions

### Core Backend: Go + SQLite
**Decision**: Go 1.21+ with mattn/go-sqlite3 driver  
**Rationale**: 
- Go provides excellent cross-compilation for multiple platforms
- Single binary deployment aligns with self-hosting philosophy
- SQLite eliminates external database dependencies
- Low memory footprint (~50MB) suitable for Raspberry Pi deployment
- **Research finding**: mattn/go-sqlite3 outperforms modernc.org/sqlite by 2-5x in insert operations, 10-100% faster in queries
**Alternatives considered**:
- modernc.org/sqlite: CGo-free but 2x slower inserts, worse performance scaling
- Rust: Better performance but steeper learning curve for contributors
- Node.js: Higher memory usage, requires runtime installation
- PostgreSQL: Requires separate database server, complicates self-hosting

### Data Storage: SQLite with WAL Mode
**Decision**: SQLite3 with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode + mattn/go-sqlite3 driver
**Rationale**:
- WAL mode enables concurrent reads while writing
- Supports ~20 concurrent users requirement
- Zero-configuration database perfect for home deployment
- Built-in full-text search for task filtering
- **Research finding**: Performance benchmarks show mattn/go-sqlite3 handles concurrent workloads better than pure Go alternatives
**Alternatives considered**:
- modernc.org/sqlite: CGo-free but performance degrades significantly with larger datasets
- BoltDB: Pure Go but lacks SQL querying capabilities
- BadgerDB: Key-value store, would require complex indexing

### Location Services Integration
**Decision**: Frontend-to-backend location transmission pattern
**Rationale**:
- **Research finding**: Go backend cannot access device GPS directly - location must come from frontend
- Browser Geolocation API requires user permission and HTTPS
- Privacy-preserving with user control over location sharing
- Supports offline operation with cached locations
**Implementation approach**:
- **Frontend**: JavaScript Geolocation API (navigator.geolocation) for web, native GPS for mobile
- **Backend**: REST endpoint to receive location coordinates from clients
- **Location sources**: GPS (mobile), browser geolocation (web), manual entry (CLI)
- **Fallback**: IP-based geolocation for approximate location when GPS unavailable

### Calendar Integration Architecture
**Decision**: CalDAV protocol with Go client libraries
**Rationale**:
- CalDAV (RFC 4791) is standard protocol supported by most calendar services
- Allows direct integration without cloud dependencies
- Can sync with Google, Outlook, Apple calendars, Nextcloud
- **Research finding**: Multiple mature Go CalDAV libraries available (samedi/caldav-go, dolanor/caldav-go)
**Implementation approach**:
- Use dolanor/caldav-go (most actively maintained fork) for CalDAV client
- Support WebDAV ACL (RFC 3744) for access control
- Provider-specific optimizations for Google Calendar API as fallback
- Local calendar cache in SQLite with iCalendar format storage
- Bi-directional sync with conflict resolution

### Task Filtering Engine
**Decision**: Rule-based engine with SQL query generation  
**Rationale**:
- Transparent and debuggable (FR-020 requirement)
- Leverages SQLite's query optimizer
- Can generate "why shown/hidden" explanations
**Implementation approach**:
- Rule definitions in Go structs
- Dynamic SQL query builder
- Audit log of applied rules per query

### Natural Language Processing
**Decision**: Local NLP with optional cloud enhancement  
**Rationale**:
- Privacy-first with on-device processing
- Simple rule-based parsing for common patterns
- Optional OpenAI/Anthropic API for complex queries
**Implementation approach**:
- Regex-based extraction for common patterns
- Time expression parser (chrono-like)
- Location name resolution via local geocoding

### Frontend Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Go library with multiple binding approaches using proven patterns
**Rationale**:
- Core logic remains in Go for consistency
- Each frontend uses appropriate integration method
- Maintains single source of truth for business logic
- **Research finding**: Gomobile provides viable mobile integration with good performance characteristics
**Integration methods**:
1. **Web**: HTTP API server mode with REST endpoints
2. **Mobile**: Gomobile bindings (gomobile bind for library bindings, gomobile build for all-Go apps)
3. **Desktop**: Native Go GUI (Fyne/Wails) or Electron with HTTP API
4. **CLI**: Direct library usage through Go packages
5. **Terminal UI**: Bubble Tea framework with direct library calls

**Gomobile Performance Notes**:
- Language bindings have overhead but not critical for this use case
- iOS Swift bindings perform better than Android Kotlin bindings
- Library binding approach preferred over all-Go apps for UI flexibility
- Type limitations: only subset of Go types supported in bindings

### Authentication & Multi-tenancy
**Decision**: Simple user/password with session tokens  
**Rationale**:
- Meets FR-011 requirement for simple setup
- Instance admin creates users directly
- No complex SSO/OAuth for home deployment
**Implementation**:
- Argon2 password hashing
- JWT or simple session tokens
- User isolation at database level

### Real-time Synchronization
**Decision**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for web, polling for others  
**Rationale**:
- SSE simpler than WebSockets for one-way updates
- Eventual consistency acceptable (FR-015)
- Polling fallback for environments without SSE
**Implementation**:
- SSE endpoint for task list changes
- Configurable poll intervals for mobile/desktop
- Change detection via SQLite triggers

### Performance Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: Query result caching with smart invalidation  
**Rationale**:
- Sub-100ms response time requirement
- Location/time-based cache keys
- Reduces database load for frequent queries
**Implementation**:
- In-memory LRU cache for filtered task lists
- Cache invalidation on task/context changes
- Prepared statement caching in SQLite

## Integration Points

### External Data Sources (FR-026)
**Weather**: OpenWeatherMap API with local caching  
**Traffic**: Google Maps API with fallback to OSM  
**Store Hours**: Google Places API with manual override  
**Design**: All external sources optional with graceful degradation

### Analytics & Metrics (FR-021)
**Time Tracking**: Automatic via task state transitions  
**Completion Patterns**: SQL aggregation queries  
**Productivity Metrics**: Configurable dashboards  
**Export**: CSV/JSON export for external analysis

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All data stored locally by default
- Encryption at rest via SQLite encryption extension (optional)
- No telemetry or phone-home behavior
- External API keys stored encrypted

### Network Security
- HTTPS only for API mode (Let's Encrypt integration)
- CORS configuration for web frontends
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input sanitization for natural language processing

## Migration & Upgrade Path

### Database Migrations
- Golang-migrate for schema versioning
- Backward-compatible changes when possible
- Migration testing in CI pipeline

### API Versioning
- URL path versioning (/api/v1, /api/v2)
- Deprecation warnings in headers
- Parallel API version support

## Testing Strategy

### Test Data Generation
- Faker for realistic task data
- Time-based test scenarios
- Location fixture data

### Performance Testing
- Go benchmarks for core operations
- SQLite query analysis
- Load testing with 20 concurrent users

## Development Workflow

### Build System
- justfile for common operations
- Go modules for dependency management
- Docker for development environment (optional)

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for testing
- Cross-compilation for releases
- Automated version bumping
