# Feature Specification: Context-Aware Task Management System ("Here and Now")

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Complete  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can manage tasks that need to be completed. It should have powerful filtering that is context aware. This include knowing the users current location and calendar so that every task can be done here and now. The Goal is to never show a task that can not be completed at that moment. This should also include prioritizing what needs to get done based on many factors importance and dependencies etc. An important part of getting it done is handing off tasks and shared lists. Being able to assign a task to another person or have a list of shared tasks to accomplish together."

## Product Vision & Philosophy

### Core Philosophy
- **Flexible with Strong Defaults**: The system is flexible but provides excellent defaults that cover most use cases without configuration
- **Productivity First**: Primary goal is increasing productivity through smart filtering; reducing task anxiety is a beneficial side effect
- **Always Surface Important Tasks**: Most important and urgent tasks always visible regardless of context when action is needed
- **Always Show Something Actionable**: Default view always displays at least one task that can be done now (never empty unless truly nothing to do)
- **Utilitarian Design**: Focus on functionality over gamification; this is a serious productivity tool

### Intelligence & Automation
- **Rule-Based System Initially**: Start with transparent, predictable rule-based filtering that users can understand and reason about
- **Predictable Behavior**: Users must be able to accurately predict what the system will do in any situation
- **External Data Integration**: Support for traffic, weather, store hours, etc., while maintaining self-hosting compatibility
- **Future ML Enhancement**: Rule-based foundation allows for optional ML improvements later

### Task Management
- **Frictionless Input**: Multiple input methods (manual, email, voice, photo/OCR) with emphasis on reducing friction
- **Natural Language Processing**: Support natural commands like "Pick up milk when I'm near a grocery store"
- **Flexible Structure**: Task data structure flexible but in predictable, expected ways
- **Comprehensive Context**: System needs extensive context about user's life to be effective

### Collaboration & Hierarchy
- **Getting Things Done Platform**: Primary focus on individual productivity with essential collaboration features
- **Reality of Mixed Ecosystems**: Recognizes not everyone in user's life will use the same task manager
- **Organizational Hierarchies**: Support for hierarchical structures (not just flat lists)
- **Strong Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics on task completion, time spent, and productivity patterns

### User Experience
- **Magic Moments**: 
  - "Oh yeah, now is the perfect time to do that" - when seeing the right task at the right time
  - End-of-day satisfaction from not letting the day slip by
- **Scheduled Downtime**: Support for periods when task notifications should be minimized
- **Transparency**: Users can view the reasoning behind why tasks are/aren't showing
- **Emergency Override**: Critical tasks can override all filters with clear action options

### Deployment & Business Model
- **Self-Hosted First**: Designed for self-hosting as the primary deployment model
- **Individual & Family Focus**: Target individual users and families (not enterprise initially)
- **Free and Open Source**: Core system FOSS with potential paid cloud services for complex integrations
- **Privacy by Design**: User data stays under user control

### Differentiation
- **The Specialized Tool**: Not just reminders + calendar, but comprehensive context-aware task filtering
- **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminates need for multiple specialized tools by being the definitive "what to do now" system
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: More thorough than simple location reminders or time blocking

### Failure Recovery
- **Important Tasks Always Visible**: Deadlines and critical tasks never hidden completely
- **Debug Mode**: Users can inspect all conditions considered for any task's visibility
- **Impossible Task Detection**: System alerts users when tasks become impossible (cancelled events, closed stores)
- **Time Zone Aware**: Proper handling of distributed teams across time zones

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (users, assignees), actions (create, filter, prioritize, assign, share), 
     data (tasks, locations, calendar events, lists), constraints (context-aware, real-time)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a busy professional with multiple responsibilities across different locations and time constraints, I want a task management system that only shows me tasks I can actually complete right now based on my current location, available time, and other contextual factors, so that I can focus on what's immediately actionable rather than being overwhelmed by a full task list.

### Additional User Stories

**Remote Worker Story**
As a remote worker who splits time between home, coffee shops, and co-working spaces, I want to see only tasks appropriate for my current environment (e.g., no video calls at a noisy coffee shop, no printing tasks when away from home), so I can be productive regardless of where I'm working.

**Parent Story**
As a parent juggling work and family responsibilities, I want to see household tasks only when I'm at home and have enough time between meetings, and work tasks only during business hours when I have childcare, so I can maintain work-life balance.

**Team Lead Story**
As a team lead managing multiple projects and team members, I want to delegate tasks to my team and track their progress without those tasks cluttering my personal view, while still being notified of blockers or completions, so I can focus on my own work while maintaining oversight.

**Student Story**
As a student with classes at different campus locations, I want to see study tasks for the library when I'm there, lab work when I'm in the science building, and homework when I have breaks between classes, so I can maximize my productivity between classes.

**Contractor/Freelancer Story**
As a contractor working for multiple clients, I want to see only tasks for the client whose office I'm currently at, and personal business tasks when I'm at home, so I can maintain clear boundaries and focus on the right client at the right time.

**Couple/Family Story**
As part of a couple sharing household responsibilities, I want to share grocery lists that update in real-time and home maintenance tasks that either of us can complete, so we can efficiently divide labor without duplication of effort.

**Field Service Technician Story**
As a field service technician visiting multiple customer sites daily, I want to see only tasks for my current location and the next scheduled stop, with travel time considered, so I can complete all necessary work at each site without forgetting location-specific tasks.

**Healthcare Worker Story**
As a healthcare worker with rotating shifts and multiple facility locations, I want tasks filtered by both my current facility and remaining shift time, with critical patient-related tasks always visible regardless of context, so I can provide consistent patient care.

**Small Business Owner Story**
As a small business owner wearing multiple hats, I want to batch similar tasks (all calls, all emails, all inventory tasks) when I'm in the right context and have sufficient time blocks, so I can work more efficiently through context switching.

**Commuter Story**
As someone with a long daily commute on public transit, I want to see tasks I can complete on my phone during my commute (emails, planning, reading) automatically surface during those times, so I can make productive use of travel time.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Core Filtering Scenarios**
1. **Given** a user has tasks with location requirements, **When** they open the app at home, **Then** only tasks that can be completed at home are displayed
2. **Given** a user has a meeting in 30 minutes, **When** they view their task list, **Then** only tasks that can be completed in less than 30 minutes are shown
3. **Given** a task has dependencies on other incomplete tasks, **When** viewing the current task list, **Then** the dependent task is hidden until prerequisites are completed
4. **Given** a user is at a coffee shop with poor internet, **When** they view tasks, **Then** tasks requiring video calls or large downloads are hidden
5. **Given** a user is commuting on public transit, **When** they check tasks, **Then** only mobile-friendly tasks (reading, planning, emails) are shown

**Collaboration Scenarios**
6. **Given** a user wants to delegate a task, **When** they assign it to another user, **Then** the task appears in the assignee's list and is removed from the assigner's active list
7. **Given** multiple users share a task list, **When** one user completes a task, **Then** all users see the updated status in real-time
8. **Given** a shared grocery list, **When** one partner adds items while shopping, **Then** the other partner sees updates immediately
9. **Given** a team lead delegates a task with a deadline, **When** the deadline approaches without completion, **Then** the team lead receives an escalation notification
10. **Given** a task is rejected by an assignee, **When** the rejection occurs, **Then** the task returns to the owner with rejection reason

**Priority & Scheduling Scenarios**
11. **Given** a user has tasks with different priorities, **When** viewing filtered tasks, **Then** they are ordered by a combination of priority, deadline urgency, and estimated completion time
12. **Given** a critical task becomes available, **When** the user meets its context requirements, **Then** it appears at the top of the list regardless of other factors
13. **Given** a user has back-to-back meetings, **When** they have a 15-minute gap, **Then** only tasks marked as "quick wins" (‚â§15 min) appear
14. **Given** tasks are tagged for batching (all calls, all emails), **When** the user enters "focus time", **Then** similar tasks are grouped together

**Context Switching Scenarios**
15. **Given** a contractor arrives at a client site, **When** their location updates, **Then** personal tasks disappear and client-specific tasks appear
16. **Given** a parent's calendar shows school pickup at 3pm, **When** it's 2:30pm, **Then** only tasks completable before leaving are shown
17. **Given** a healthcare worker starts their shift, **When** they badge into a facility, **Then** tasks for that facility and shift appear
18. **Given** a student enters the library, **When** location services detect this, **Then** study and research tasks become visible

**Advanced Filtering Scenarios**
19. **Given** a user has recurring daily tasks, **When** they complete today's instance, **Then** tomorrow's instance remains hidden until tomorrow
20. **Given** weather conditions are poor, **When** the user checks tasks, **Then** outdoor tasks are automatically hidden
21. **Given** a user sets "Do Not Disturb" mode, **When** active, **Then** only silent/solo tasks appear (no calls or collaborative tasks)
22. **Given** multiple valid locations for a task, **When** the user is at any of those locations, **Then** the task becomes visible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when location services are disabled or unavailable? (Client-specific implementation detail)
- How does system handle calendar sync failures? (Implementation detail)
- What if a shared task is edited by multiple users simultaneously? (Implementation detail for conflict resolution)
- How are circular dependencies between tasks handled?
- What happens when an assigned user rejects the task? Task returns to owner with rejection notification
