# HereAndNow Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles
    
### [Selfhosted]
Able to run fully self-hosted; No external dependencies except for OS and hardware

### [Home First]
Focused on user running on their home network and able to be run on low-end hardware

### [Simple by Default - Powerful when Needed]
Default configurations should work for most users; Advanced features and configurations should be opt-in and well-documented.

### [Everywhere Access]
Seamless access across devices and platforms

## Governance
Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan
